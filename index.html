    <h1>Future of Humanity Reading Group</h1>
    <p>Yale University, Spring 2026</p>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>This reading group surveys foundational questions about the long-term future of human civilization, drawing on philosophy, economics, physics, computer science, and other fields. We meet biweekly and aim for serious engagement.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "I think we are fairly profoundly in the dark on such matters. You could say that we are like ants, who may be very busy schlepping needles from one point to another, but with little notion as to what they are doing, why they are doing it, or whether in the final reckoning it was good that they did it."
        <br>— Nick Bostrom

    <p>I'm David Bloom, YC '26, majoring in math and philosophy. I've been interested in questions regarding macro strategy for the last two years or so, spurred by my interest in existential risk from AI. My academic interests include normative ethics, philosophy of mind and cognitive science, moral patienthood, and metaethics.</p>
