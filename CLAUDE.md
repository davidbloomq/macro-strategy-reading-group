# Macro Strategy Reading Group

## Project overview

**Macro strategy** is a term from Nick Bostrom, referring to the effort to understand the larger context in which human civilization exists—particularly how our current choices relate to long-term outcomes and ultimate values. In Bostrom's words:

> "My research efforts, while they may appear scattershot, generally share one aim, which is to better understand what I call our 'macrostrategic situation'. By this I mean the larger context in which human civilization exists, and in particular how our current choices relate to long-term outcomes or ultimate values. I think we are fairly profoundly in the dark on such matters. You could say that we are like ants, who may be very busy schlepping needles from one point to another, but with little notion as to what they are doing, why they are doing it, or whether in the final reckoning it was good that they did it."

This reading group will survey foundational literature in macro strategy, drawing on philosophy, economics, physics, computer science, sociology, and political science. We meet biweekly (once every two weeks) and aim for serious engagement—participants should be professors, graduate students, or advanced and motivated undergraduates.
