    <h1>Future of Humanity Reading Group</h1>
    <p>Yale University, Spring 2026 | <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerlGbCNxj-Nt0_ZmSHcc-T_dab_KIIwafB6bsI3U-_l93-IQ/viewform">Interest form</a></p>

    <blockquote><i>"I must study politics and war, that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy… in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture."</i><br>— John Adams, 1780</blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>"My research efforts, while they may appear scattershot, generally share one aim, which is to better understand what I call our 'macrostrategic situation'. By this I mean the larger context in which human civilization exists, and in particular how our current choices relate to long-term outcomes or ultimate values. I think we are fairly profoundly in the dark on such matters. You could say that we are like ants, who may be very busy schlepping needles from one point to another, but with little notion as to what they are doing, why they are doing it, or whether in the final reckoning it was good that they did it."</i><br>— Nick Bostrom</blockquote>

    <p>This reading group surveys foundational questions about the long-term future of human civilization. We meet biweekly.</p>
