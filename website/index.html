    <h1>Macro Strategy Reading Group</h1>
    <p>Yale University, Spring 2026</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><strong>Macro strategy</strong> refers to the effort to understand the larger context in which human civilization exists—particularly how our current choices relate to long-term outcomes and ultimate values.</p>

    <blockquote>
        "I think we are fairly profoundly in the dark on such matters. You could say that we are like ants, who may be very busy schlepping needles from one point to another, but with little notion as to what they are doing, why they are doing it, or whether in the final reckoning it was good that they did it."
        <br>— Nick Bostrom
    </blockquote>

    <p>This reading group surveys foundational literature in macro strategy, drawing on philosophy, economics, physics, computer science, and other fields. We meet biweekly and aim for serious engagement.</p>

    <h2>Organizer</h2>
    <p>David Bloom, YC '26, majoring in math and philosophy. I have been interested in questions regarding macro strategy for the last two years or so, spurred by my interest in existential risk from AI. My academic interests include normative ethics, philosophy of mind and cognitive science, moral patienthood, and metaethics.</p>
